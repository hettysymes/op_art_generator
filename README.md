## How to run

First install the necessary Python packages. These are listed in `requirements.txt`. Simply run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install the necessary dependencies.

After installation, run the Pipeline Editor GUI with the command `python3 pipeline_editor.py`. This will cause the PyQt
application to open in another window.
